### Book Nook - An E-commerce Store

Book Nook is an e-commerce store made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). This site uses a `PostgreSQL` database to retrieve information for its pages, such as author names, prices, and book titles. Additionally, some of the files for this project were written using `Typescript`:

#### Testing

Unit tests were created using `Jest` and E2E tests were run using `Cypress`. One of the `Jest` unit tests can been seen below:
